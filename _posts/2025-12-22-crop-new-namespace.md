Happy to share that I added a new feature to [CrOp](https://github.com/apulbere/crop) and also moved it to a new namespace.

This is an update for one of my [previous article](https://adrian.md/2024/07/14/crop/) where I explained a functionality we often have to implement in a typical REST service, and the library I created solves it.

Now, almost one year later had the time to add count API to the library `md.adrian.crop.service.CriteriaOperatorBuilder#getCount` and also move it to a new namespace, from `com.apulbere` to `md.adrian`.
